Progressbar Control panel
=========================

This project enables controling of several appliances in [Progressbar hackerspace](https://progressbar.sk). It uses relays connected to Arduino pins to control main lights and our [Solight library](https://github.com/Funcoil/Solight) to control the sockets using 433MHz RF transmitter.

This project also contains [Arduino Makefile](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile/), so you can avoid horrible Arduino IDE.
